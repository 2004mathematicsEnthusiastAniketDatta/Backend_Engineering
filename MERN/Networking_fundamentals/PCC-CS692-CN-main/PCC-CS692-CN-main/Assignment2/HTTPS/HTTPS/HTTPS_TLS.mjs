/**  Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
 * Node implements HTTPS client and Server on top of Transport Layer Security.
 * 
 * HTTPS/TLS Core Concepts :
 * 
 * 1. SYMMETRIC vs ASYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION:
 *    - Symmetric: Same key for encrypt/decrypt (fast, but key exchange problem)
 *    - Asymmetric: Public/Private key pairs (slower, solves key exchange)
 *    - HTTPS uses BOTH: Asymmetric for handshake, Symmetric for data transfer
 * 
 * 2. TLS HANDSHAKE PROCESS:
 *    - Client Hello: Supported cipher suites, TLS version, random bytes
 *    - Server Hello: Chosen cipher, certificate chain, server random
 *    - Key Exchange: Client generates pre-master secret, encrypts with server's public key
 *    - Session Keys: Both derive symmetric keys from pre-master + randoms
 *    - Finished: Encrypted handshake verification
 * 
 * 3. CERTIFICATES & PKI:
 *    - Certificate contains: Public key, domain name, issuer (CA), expiry
 *    - Certificate Chain: Root CA -> Intermediate CA -> Server Certificate
 *    - Browser validates: Chain of trust, domain match, expiry, revocation
 * 
 * 4. TLS VERSIONS & SECURITY:
 *    - TLS 1.0/1.1: Deprecated (vulnerable to BEAST, POODLE attacks)
 *    - TLS 1.2: Current standard, supports perfect forward secrecy
 *    - TLS 1.3: Latest, faster handshake, removes weak ciphers
 * 
 * 5. CDN INTEGRATION CHALLENGES:
 *    - Certificate Management: CDN needs valid certs for your domain
 *    - SNI (Server Name Indication): Multiple SSL certs on same IP
 *    - SSL Termination: CDN decrypts, re-encrypts to origin (end-to-end encryption)
 *    - Certificate Pinning: Can break with CDN cert rotation
 *    - HSTS Headers: CDN must properly forward security headers
 * 
 * 6. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 *    - TLS Resume: Session tickets to avoid full handshake
 *    - OCSP Stapling: CDN bundles certificate revocation status
 *    - HTTP/2 over TLS: Multiplexing, server push capabilities
 *    - Edge SSL: CDN terminates SSL at edge for lower latency
 * 
 * 7. SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
 *    - Perfect Forward Secrecy: New session keys per connection
 *    - HSTS: Force HTTPS, prevent downgrade attacks
 *    - Certificate Transparency: Public logs of all certificates issued
 *    - Mixed Content: Ensure all resources served over HTTPS
 * 
 * Real-world scaling lessons from Reddit/Google Meet backends:
 * - Certificate automation is critical (Let's Encrypt, ACME protocol)
 * - Monitor certificate expiry across thousands of domains
 * - CDN SSL termination reduces origin server CPU load significantly
 * - Regional certificate deployment for global latency optimization
